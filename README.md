# 🧠 CCNA Practice Skills Assessment – ITN Network Configuration

This repository contains my **recreated version** of the official  
**Cisco Networking Academy – CCNA: Introduction to Networks (ITN) Practice Skills Assessment (PTSA)**.  
All configurations, subnetting, and documentation were fully rebuilt by me based on the original PTSA scenario  
using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

## 🗂️ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design, configure, and document a complete IPv4/IPv6 departmental network,  
demonstrating practical routing, switching, and network management skills.

Tasks included:
- Subnetting of the 192.168.1.0/24 network  
- IPv4 and IPv6 addressing  
- Router and switch configuration  
- Secure remote management using SSH and Telnet  
- Device hardening and password policies  
- Network connectivity verification
